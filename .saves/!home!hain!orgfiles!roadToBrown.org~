1. The Road to Brown or what we call the early years of the Long Civil Rights Movement (1936-1954), is marked by a major fight for access and equity in higher education that is referred to in Advancing Democracy as the Texas University Movement. That movement was characterized by what came to be known as the fight for separate equality, that is to say a political and legal strategy of equalizing the quality of African American school buildings and resources, teacher salaries and credentials, per pupil expenditures, etc., with those within the white part of the dual system. By the late 1940s the NAACP legal team led by Thurgood Marshall renounced that strategic orientation in favor of what they called an all-out assault on Jim Crow by filing lawsuits that claimed black access to white schools and the physical integration of white students, staff and teachers and the ending of a racially separate, dual system was the only outcome that would satisfy the needs of the black students to equal protection of the law. Discuss what you have learned about this period leading up to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown and the next phase of the movement that would unfold. A strong essay should include references from The Road to Brown documentary, lectures, and Advancing Democracy.

2. Ekwueme Michael Thelwell in “The Arc of the Universe” essay writes of 1954, the year of Supreme decision in Brown. He says the ruling had "profound and far-reaching consequences” at every level of U.S. society. Its declaration that the white supremacist doctrine of separate but equal was against the country’s constitution led to "massive trauma and convulsions in the body politic.” Why and how did that look as you can discern from lecture, Thelwell’s essay, videos (Eyes on the Prize, etc.) and Advancing Democracy. Cite examples in your essay.

3. Explain what you know about the “Backlash” or massive resistance that arose to the nascent Civil Rights Movement using what you’ve learned from lectures, the Eyes on the Prize documentary, and course readings like Advancing Democracy. Cite examples in your essay and conclude by relating how these lessons from the past resonate with you in the present moment from the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol at the beginning of this year to the racist incidents going on here on campus. Is the country witnessing a kind of backlash against the movement for Black Lives, Defund, etc. in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, et al?
